## Description

Implementing linear regression algrithm using tensorflow.

## Summary

Linear Regression is a very common statistical method that allows us to learn a function or relationship from a given set of continuous data. 
For example, we are given some data points of x and corresponding y and we need to learn the relationship between them that is called a hypothesis.

In this script I used admission-predict data to implement Linear-regression. 
with considering the features the algoriyhm can predict if a student get admission or not.
